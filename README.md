# Devils-railway
College project

this is a 2 2017 project some of the code can appear to be not working and/or be legacy depending on the version

This project was created in a period of 6 months where i (Carlos Alberto Zgierski da Silveira) was the lead Develloper of the team. This project was very ambicious for less than 6 months, but after many sprints we delievered a stable game, focused on narrative and story telling.

The project was bassed on the Brazilian History, more especifically the devil's railway.
